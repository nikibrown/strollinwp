                            <p>
                                Due to the Covid-19 crisis, and the restrictions from all local and
                                state officials, our 9th annual Toni’s Race scheduled for May 9th,
                                2020 was cancelled. This space will be updated as we determine when
                                it will be safe to hold our event. Currently, we are hoping to
                                schedule our 10th Annual Toni’s Race in the fall 2021.
